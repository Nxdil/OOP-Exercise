# OOP-Exercise

The following program is a Cricket league manager inspired by:- https://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup-super-league/standings

You can add/delete multiple Cricket clubs to the league manager table and thereafter add a match in-between two teams. The details such as season Win, season losses, and the season draws and season total points will be calculated and recorded in the table. You can then save the current data into a text file and automatically load the data every time the program starts (I have entered sample data for your convenience).

The program uses all the core OOP concepts, and comments are added throughout the code.
